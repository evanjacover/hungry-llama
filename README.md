hungry-llama
============

Edmund is a Hungry Llama, but he is a very picky eater and his tates change very quickly. This is a multiplayer
web-based game where players need to quickly figure out what to feed Edmund.

Oh, and Edmund only communicates through digital logic diagrams. He's weird like that. 

(Hat tip to the Apple II game Rocky's Boots, one of my favorites.)
